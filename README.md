Mission

Make the life of cross platform mobile development as easy and awesome as humanly possible while also greatly increasing the shared code pie slice across mobile platforms but also for projects in general. Building on existing and proven patterns and practices we want to enable you to write high quality and testable code while leveraging your existing skillset as a .NET developer.
